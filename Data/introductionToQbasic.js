To tell computer what to do and how to do we have to use some language called programming language. Lots of programming lanauge are there such as C, C++, Qbasic, Python, Java, C#, etc but the job of each and every programming language is to tell computer what to do and how to do.",

So the our computer do not understand program written in High level language and Assembly level language. Because of that we need to convert program written in High level language and Assembly level language into machine level language since our computer only understand machine level language. Here we need language processor software to convert program written High level language and Assembly level language into machine level language.",

PRINT statement is used to display the message i.e. content present inside quotation (''), into console screen/output screen.
